Hi there! 
This is a small project I've been working on for a short while.
While it technically has some features, it is extremely bugged.
It will be updated in the future, however main developement has stopped and it will be ocasionally fixed.


All you need to know about this project: 
It is a short RPG-like adventure, where you have to do some simple chores.
There is a little bit of lore which I may expand on someday, in a diffrent project.

Anyway, I will abandon this project for now due to error happening that I am not able to overcome as of the moment.
